create a full stack project where nodejs is backend and nextjs is frontend;
on frontend, I can specify an entry url which is entry sitemap for a given website
once entry site map is provided, enable button "Start Analysis"
You need to fetch all urls within the given sitemap and push them into a global list
if there are other sitemaps specified, then you will need to go inside such sitemap and retrieve all urls included
the process could be recursive until you have parsed all encountered site map
for every record of urls within the globallist, I need to know the source sitemap for the url, for example
if url1 is coming from the rootsitemap, then in the global list the corresponding record will be like
  {
      "url": "url1",
      "source":"rootSiteMap.xml"
  }
if url2 is coming from a nested multiple level sitemap, then the corresponding record in global list will be:
  {
      "url": "url1",
      "source":"rootSiteMap.xml=>childSiteMap.xml=>grandchildSiteMap.xml"
  }
